I obtained my PhD in 2010 with Francesca Granucci and Ivan Zanoni at the University of Milano-Bicocca, Italy. Here, I contributed to establish CD14, a co-receptor for the bacterial component lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as a central organizer of inflammatory responses in innate immune cells (Nature 2009, Cell 2011, JCI 2012). I then did a postdoc with Gioacchino Natoli at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO), where I discovered latent enhancers: a class of regulatory elements enabling transcriptional and epigenetic memory in activated macrophages (Cell 2013).\
\
I established my group at the San Raffaele-Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-Tiget) in 2015 – at the age of 32. I was later appointed as Assistant Professor and, in 2022, I became Associate Professor of Tissue Biology at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan.\
\
I have published has published >35 articles in top scientific journals such as Cell (2x), Nature (2x), Nature Immunology (3x), Immunity (3x), Nature Medicine (2x), Science Translational Medicine (2x), and Nature Communications (3x), among others. As of 2022, four of my papers have been cited > 500 times and nine others received > 100 citations.\
\
My group has received funding from competitive grants national agencies, including the Telethon Foundation, the Italian Association for Cancer Research (AIRC), and the Italian Ministry of Health. In 2017,  I was awarded a Starting Grant from the European Research Council (ERC) – the most prestigious scientific recognition for early-career investigators in Europe. In 2022, I was nominated Italy’s 40 under 40 by the “Fortune” magazine. I currently serve as a panel member for the Scientific and Technical Committee of the Italian Ministry of Health, as well as a reviewer for major European funding agencies and scientific journals.\
\
I love engaging in public outreach and research dissemination projects (European Researchers’ Night, Pint of Science, talks at middle and high schools, cultural and societies). I have also been live on National TV channels for the annual fundraising campaign of Telethon Foundation. As a prime example, here is my latest performance with the “Base Editors” (formerly The Kapsids), a rock band of friends and fellow scientists from SR-Tiget.\
\
When I’m not in the lab, I enjoy being outdoors and doing endurance sports. I am a passionate climber, mountaineer, and sky-runner. My next challenge? Running an ultra-trail race – 100 KM with >5000 m positive elevation – in Tenerife!\
