Luca is a Masterâ€™s student in Medical biotechnology from University of Milano-Bicocca that joined the Ostuni Lab for his M.Sc. thesis internship. In the lab, he works on mouse macrophages with the aim to dissect epigenomic control of innate immune response, especially regarding how inflammatory and immunomodulatory stimuli impact on chromatin modification and remodeling. When far from the bench, he enjoys watching and playing sports (volleyball, tennis), reading, and listening to podcasts.
